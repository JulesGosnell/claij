This project is here to answer some questions:

- What if when setting out to code something ambitious we used the right language instead of hobbling ourselves before we even started

- What if reducing the number of concerns that we ask an LLM to deal with improves its output

- What if having one AI check another AIs homework results in better output

- What if we used FSMs to coordinate LLMs as they work upon their appointed problem

- What if these FSMs were part of a self-descriptive system

- What if we fed these FSMs back into themelves and asked the LLMs to improve them

- What if we gave the entire system to the LLMs and asked them to improve it.

- What if these improvements could be applied to the system dynamically as the LLMs were using it.

- What could we use a system like this to do for us ?

- Could such a system eventually get to the point where it could code up our app from zero and maintaint it going forwards...

- Given access to the right tools, Could it replace a competent software development test, QA department and maybe even Ops team ?

- What, How, When ?
