If you ask the MC to do something for which it cannot find a suitable fsm, it should be able to ask you how to do it and then define one on the fly...

WIP (work in progress) might be a useful metric to limit the number of concurrent AI incarnations and therefore ttoken consumption rate, if this is not alredy been limited naturally by the shape of the development

Bath/Bed/Beach-driven-development - if we ported the tts and stt frontends to IOS/Android we could be doing bath-driven or beach-drive
 - looks like this just needs a bit of ClojureScript in  page and I could do mic and speaker i/o on both IOS and Android
 - killer app !

http interaction is async

fsm is directionless

requests as well as responses must be structured.


we are implementing json-zip - but as a dynamically developed DSL - the DSL is the compression



"please tell me what files are in the CWD"

->chat-request

matches "chat" transition
takes you to "perform-task" fsm
 - sends async request to a "dev"
 - dev decides they need to issue and mcp call
 - they reply with an mcp-request
matches an mcp-request transition
 - takes you to an mcp node
 - performs the mcp action
 - produces an mcp-response
matches an mcp-response transition
 -



The path through the FSM defines the memory required for the task.
Perfect memory is retained during the execution of the task.
At the end of the task, the memory is summarised into projects global state

Planning produces a dependency graph of story-tasks
At the end of planning, we do a topological sort and serialise these into the "ready for dev" column
Memory 

Every request and response will be stored for later analysis - so schemas must be versioned
Retrospectives are about analysing previous tasks/story workflows and improving prompts, data structures, fsms to better accomodae he process.

It is now possible to run ONNX models on Clojure without Python
Grok thinks we could run Whisper using just Clojure - investigate
