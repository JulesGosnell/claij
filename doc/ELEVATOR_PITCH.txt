CLAIJ Elevator Pitch.:

"The factory is the product" - Elon Musk

CLAIJ is (will be) an AI-driven Workflow for producing AI-driven Workflows, as well as a platform on which to run... AI-driven Workflows.

That is to say, that instead of having to manually bolt stuff together in LangChain or LangGraph, you will give CLAIJ your problem domain and ask it to design a Workflow to solve your problem.

It will then produce a workflow and run it for you.

Furthermore, as it runs it, solving your problem and learning on the job, it will review itself and seek to improve your workflow to do whatever it is doing, but better.
