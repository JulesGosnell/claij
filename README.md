**Clojure AI Integration Junction** - A playground and proof-of-concept for orchestrating AI technologies through Clojure.

## Vision

**claij** is an AI integration hub that uses Clojure as the coordination layer to connect multiple AI models, tools, and interaction modalities. The goal is to create a unified platform where different AI technologies can be seamlessly orchestrated through an elegant Clojure-based DSL.

Think of it as a **"Clojure AI conductor"** - leveraging Clojure's strengths in data transformation and functional composition to wire together the modern AI stack.

**Bootstrapping AI with AI**: claij aims to not only provide AI acceleration to other projects but to be AI-accelerated itself. We're bootstrapping our way out of the chicken-and-egg problem - using AI to build better AI tooling. The project sits alongside developers in their natural workflow, enabling communication via speech and text directly from Emacs or a Clojure REPL.

## Architecture

### Integration Points

**claij** connects:

1. **LLM Connections via OpenRouter** - Access to multiple AI models:
   - Claude (Anthropic)
   - GPT (OpenAI)
   - Grok (xAI)
   - Gemini (Google)
   - Any other LLM supported by OpenRouter

2. **MCP (Model Context Protocol) Backends** - Give AI models access to tools and data sources through the standardized MCP protocol

3. **Text Input from Emacs** - Direct text interaction through your favorite editor

4. **Text Input from Clojure REPL** - REPL-driven AI conversations for interactive development

5. **Voice-to-Text Microservice** - Speech input processing (local or remote)

6. **Coordination DSL** - A Clojure REPL-based DSL to orchestrate complex multi-step AI workflows

### MCP Bridges

**claij** is currently experimenting with several MCP (Model Context Protocol) bridges to deeply integrate AI into the development workflow:

- **clojure-mcp** - Provides AI access to bash commands, Clojure REPL evaluation, file operations, and project introspection
- **emacs-mcp** - Enables AI to work directly within Emacs alongside the developer
- **clojure-language-server** - Gives AI deep understanding of Clojure projects through LSP capabilities

While we're currently focused on building a complete Clojure development environment (since claij itself is written in Clojure), the architecture is language-agnostic. Any language with an MCP integration and any editor/IDE with MCP support could leverage the same approach.

### Current Components

- **Agent Bridges** (`src/claij/agent/bridge.clj`) - MCP protocol communication
- **LLM Integrations** - Individual adapters for each AI provider
- **Request Transformation** (`src/claij/agent/xform.clj`) - Data transformation pipelines
- **Configuration** (`src/claij/agent/config.clj`) - Centralized configuration management

## Development

### Running Tests

```bash
# Unit tests (no Python required) - runs everywhere including CI
clojure -M:test --skip integration

# All tests including integration tests (requires Python environment)
clojure -M:whisper:test
```

The project uses a two-tier testing strategy:
- **Unit tests** - Fast, no external dependencies, run on any machine
- **Integration tests** - Require Python ML stack, test Whisper service with libpython-clj

This allows the project to build and test in environments lacking Python/GPU (like CI runners) while still having comprehensive tests for the full system.

## Setup

### Clojure Components

Requires:
- Java 21+
- Clojure CLI tools

Install dependencies:
```bash
clojure -P  # Download all dependencies
```

### Speech-to-Text Service

**claij** includes a Whisper speech-to-text service implemented in pure Clojure using `libpython-clj` to call Python's Whisper library.

**Features:**
- **All in-memory processing** - No temporary files for better performance
- **Pure Clojure** - Ring/Jetty HTTP server with functional composition
- **Optional Python dependency** - Project builds and tests without Python environment
- **Clean architecture** - Decomposed into testable modules

**Architecture:**
- `claij.whisper.python` - Python interop layer (model loading, transcription)
- `claij.whisper.audio` - Audio processing utilities (WAV conversion, validation)
- `claij.whisper.handler` - Ring HTTP handlers (routing, request/response)
- `claij.whisper.server` - Server lifecycle management

**Requirements:**

*Development (no Python needed):*
- Java 21+ and Clojure CLI tools
- Unit tests run without Python environment

*Production (Python required):*
- Python 3.8+ with: `openai-whisper`, `torch`, `numpy`, `soundfile`
- NVIDIA GPU with CUDA (recommended) or CPU fallback

**Setup and Run:**

```bash
# Install Python dependencies (production only)
pip install openai-whisper torch numpy soundfile

# Download Clojure dependencies
clojure -P -M:whisper

# Run the service
./bin/whisper.sh                    # defaults: port 8000, host 0.0.0.0, model small
./bin/whisper.sh 9000               # custom port
./bin/whisper.sh 8000 localhost     # custom host
./bin/whisper.sh 8000 0.0.0.0 tiny  # tiny model (faster, less accurate)
```

**API Endpoints:**
- `POST /transcribe` - multipart/form-data with `audio` field (WAV, 16kHz) â†’ `{"text": "..."}`
- `GET /health` - `{"status": "healthy", "service": "whisper-clojure"}`

**Key Benefits:**
- How Clojure can leverage Python's ML ecosystem via libpython-clj
- Functional composition and clean architecture principles
- In-memory processing for better performance
- Graceful degradation (builds/tests everywhere, runs where Python is available)

### Speech Client (Clojure)

Record and transcribe speech:
```bash
./bin/speech.sh                                    # Use default service URL
./bin/speech.sh http://custom-host:8000/transcribe # Custom service URL
WHISPER_URL=http://host:8000/transcribe ./bin/speech.sh # Via environment
```

The client will:
1. Listen for speech (detected by audio level)
2. Record until 1 second of silence
3. Send audio to Whisper service
4. Display transcribed text
5. Repeat

### Project Status

**claij** is currently a proof-of-concept playground. It's actively evolving as different integration patterns and orchestration strategies are explored.

## Goals

The aim is to create a platform where you can:
- **Switch between AI models seamlessly** - Use the best model for each task
- **Give AI tools via MCP** - Enable AI to interact with your development environment
- **Interact through multiple modalities** - Text (Emacs/REPL) or voice
- **Orchestrate complex workflows** - Chain together AI operations through Clojure code
- **Experiment freely** - A sandbox for exploring AI integration patterns

## Why Clojure?

Clojure is ideal for this kind of integration work:
- **Data-oriented** - AI interactions are fundamentally about transforming data
- **Functional composition** - Chain operations elegantly
- **REPL-driven** - Interactive development matches interactive AI workflows
- **JVM and ClojureScript** - Can run anywhere (backend, frontend, mobile)
- **Rich ecosystem** - Great libraries for HTTP, async, JSON, WebSockets, etc.
- **Python interop** - Via libpython-clj, can leverage Python's ML ecosystem while maintaining Clojure's functional elegance

**Showcasing Clojure**: Ultimately, claij should demonstrate Clojure's exceptional suitability for AI orchestration and coordination tasks. The Clojure Whisper service is a prime example - leveraging Python's ML libraries while providing better architecture, in-memory processing, and graceful degradation. While much of the current codebase is AI-generated (and thus not yet as elegant as hand-crafted Clojure), the project aims to evolve into a showcase of idiomatic Clojure's expressiveness and power in the AI domain.
